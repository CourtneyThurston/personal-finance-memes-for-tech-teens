## An introduction to financial vehicles
There are many ways to save and invest money; note that these two actions are distinct. 

**"Savings"** is a liquid or semi-liquid way to store money. This means that you are able to immediately or near-immediately withdraw money, within conditions: for U.S. banks, official savings accounts are typically limited to 6 withdrawals per month (**checking** accounts typically have no such restrictions, but also typically earn no interest). Savings accounts typically earn very small amounts of **interest** -- usually less than 1%, or between 1-2% if you're really lucky (more common with credit unions or online banks, which tend to impose additional restrictions to earn these higher rates). However, **inflation** typically averages between 2-3%; this means that **money stored in a savings account is typically losing value over time**, not gaining it, even though the balance is higher each year (because inflation typically outpaces interest). 

Though this may make it seem like it's a bad idea to have a savings account, there are still advantages; they are safer than storing money under a mattress/in a box/etc, as banks ensure basic financial vehicles like checking and savings accounts (NOT investment vehicles) up to $250,000 per FDIC Insurance. For their safety advantages, savings accounts are widely regarded as a wise choice for emergency funds.

**Emergency funds** are a lump of money that many financial leaders recommend all adults have: the specific amounts vary based on your expenses. For adults who have graduated from college and are in the workforce, it is commonly recommended to have between 6-12 months of expenses (total of rent, utilities, food budget, insurance payments, etc etc etc) saved as an emergency fund. Doing so allows you to maintain your lifestyle if you lose your job, and/or help you 'weather the storm' if a medical disaster strikes, your home or car requires an emergency repair, etc. Essentially, emergency funds give you a cushion for unexpected events. Here are some approximate guidelines that I've seen work for people:

* Especially anxious adults: 12 months of expenses
* Especially anxious students: 6 months of expenses
* Adults who have graduated from college and are working: 6-12 months of expenses
* Students who are in college and are working: 3 months of expenses
* Students who are in college and are not working: 6 months of expenses

The amount you need in your emergency fund naturally varies wildly on personal circumstance. Students who have heavy support from their parents and have no risk of losing that support (regardless of performance in school, etc) may want to only keep a month or two of expenses on hand, if that (students with a family credit card may feel that this is unnecessary). Students who are working their way through school but would have parental support if a true disaster struck may also only need a month or two of expenses (or enough for a flight home, etc). Students without parental support of any kind typically want to provide themselves with a greater cushion should a serious emergency strike; however, meeting your emergency fund goal can be hard for anyone. Ideally, you set a realistic goal, contribute as much as you can to it over time, and keep that money somewhere safe--like a checking or savings account--and leave it untouched (NO drawing from it for splurges, etc--that stuff should be budgeted for and kept separate).
