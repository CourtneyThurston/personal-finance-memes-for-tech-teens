## An introduction to financial products and vehicles

### Common institution types
**Credit unions** -- smaller than banks, often offer higher interest rates on accounts (good) and lower interest rates on things like loans and credit cards (good), and are run by members (some people view this as more risky, as there are sometimes less government restrictions on what the credit union can do).

**Banks** -- larger than credit unions, typically offer lower interest rates on accounts (not good) and higher interest rates on things like loans and credit cards (not good for loans, N/A on credit cards if you're not running a balance--and it's recommended by many financial experts that you don't. See the below section on credit cards for more info), and are run by the bank itself (some people view this as safer, as there are sometimes more government restrictions on what banks can do).

**Brokerages** -- also commonly referred to as **custodians**, brokerage **firms**, etc. These are financial institutions that offer and sometimes also manage funds (some brokerages manage their own funds and also offer others, some bring in outside management, etc: there are many combinations). Unlike banks which ensure your money up to 250k under FDIC Insurance, and credit unions which often offer similar assurances through other agencies, brokerage firms are regulated by parties such as FINRA/the SEC but promises about actual returns cannot be made; there is a fundamental risk in investing. 

### Common non-investment vehicle types
There are many ways to save and invest money; note that these two actions are distinct. 

**"Savings"** is a liquid or semi-liquid way to store money. This means that you are able to immediately or near-immediately withdraw money, within conditions: some savings accounts has minimum balance requirements, and for U.S. banks, official savings accounts are typically limited to 6 withdrawals per month (**checking** accounts typically have no such restrictions, but also typically earn no interest). Savings accounts typically earn very small amounts of **interest** -- usually less than 1%, or between 1-2% if you're really lucky (more common with credit unions or online banks, which tend to impose additional restrictions to earn these higher rates). However, **inflation** typically averages between 2-3%; this means that **money stored in a savings account is typically losing value over time**, not gaining it, even though the balance is higher each year (because inflation typically outpaces interest). 

Though this may make it seem like it's a bad idea to have a savings account, there are still advantages; they are safer than storing money under a mattress/in a box/etc, as banks ensure basic financial vehicles like checking and savings accounts (NOT investment vehicles) up to $250,000 per FDIC Insurance. For their safety advantages, savings accounts are widely regarded as a wise choice for emergency funds. 

**"Money market" accounts** are a category of savings accounts that typically earn a bit more (0.5-2% APY) than an average savings account, because the minimum balance required is typically far higher. Many brokerage firms offer money market accounts as an intermediate step between sending your money to the firm, and actually using that money to buy a mutual fund (see below for more detail on those). Additionally, if you choose not to **re-invest dividents** from investments automatically (you probably should choose this option), most brokerages will send those dividends to a money market account (in this context, also called a **"settlement account"**).

**Emergency funds** are a lump of money that many financial leaders recommend all adults have: the specific amounts vary based on your expenses. For adults who have graduated from college and are in the workforce, it is commonly recommended to have between 6-12 months of expenses (total of rent, utilities, food budget, insurance payments, etc etc etc) saved as an emergency fund. Doing so allows you to maintain your lifestyle if you lose your job, and/or help you 'weather the storm' if a medical disaster strikes, your home or car requires an emergency repair, etc. Essentially, emergency funds give you a cushion for unexpected events. Here are some approximate guidelines that I've seen work for people:

* Especially anxious adults: 12 months of expenses
* Especially anxious students: 6 months of expenses
* Adults who have graduated from college and are working: 6-12 months of expenses
* Students who are in college and are working with some parental support: 1-3 months of expenses
* Students who are in college and are working with no parental support: 3-6 months of expenses
* Students who are in college and have full parental support (trust fund, etc): 1-3 months of expenses or N/A

The amount you need in your emergency fund naturally varies wildly on personal circumstance. Students who have heavy support from their parents and have no risk of losing that support (regardless of performance in school, etc) may want to only keep a month or two of expenses on hand, if that (students with a family credit card may feel that this is unnecessary). Students who are working their way through school but would have parental support if a true disaster struck may also only need a month or two of expenses (or enough for a flight home, etc). Students without parental support of any kind typically want to provide themselves with a greater cushion should a serious emergency strike; however, meeting your emergency fund goal can be hard for anyone. Ideally, you set a realistic goal, contribute as much as you can to it over time, and keep that money somewhere safe--like a checking or savings account--and leave it untouched (NO drawing from it for splurges, etc--that stuff should be budgeted for and kept separate). 

**CDs** are another financial vehicle that most banks and credit unions will offer where you earn a higher interest rate on your money in exchange for not being able to access that money (without penalty) for a period of time. The longer that period of time, the higher the interest rate typically will be. For instance, CDs with durations between 1-3 years typically carry interest rates of between 0-2%; CDs with durations of 3 years and longer are more likely to have interest rates between 2-4%. At the higher end of this scale, the interest earned by your CD may slightly outpace inflation. For this reason, when saving for further-off purchases (but less than 10 years away) such as down payments on a house, etc, a CD may be an appropriate financial vehicle. 

**Bonds** are the last category of typical vehicles offered by banks et al. However, they are not necessarily as low risk as the previous vehicles discussed: they **can even be considered investment products depending on what kind of bond they are**. You can buy bonds in companies that offer them (more risky, as they depend on the company not going under/honoring the bonds), or bonds from the government (less risky, as they are assured a certain value by the government, which essentially stands unless a cataclysmic World-War-II-but-where-the-axis-powers-win-instead-level event occurs). Bonds typically work in the following way, though of course the exact mechanism and terms will depend on the source of the bond (corporate or government) and series of the bond (basically what specific "product" of bond you bought); you buy a bond for a certain value X, you wait a certain number of years Y, and it matures to a certain value of Z after the number of years Y has passed. For instance, Series EE bonds could be bought at different denominations: a bond could be bought for $25, and would be worth $50 after a **"full maturity period"** of 20 years; the bond could be held for another 10 years on top of that (so 30 years total) and continue earning interest at the bonds interest rate (series EE bonds are currently fixed at 0.10%). If you cashed the bond before those 20 years, you would earn whatever the interest had pushed the total balance to (if you had held it for at least 5 years for Series EE bonds, known as the **penalty duration**--withdrawing before 5 years would incur a penalty). Note that there are both fixed (interest rate doesn't change) and variable (interest rate can change) bonds. A quick bulleted breakdown if the above example was confusing:

* You bought a $50 Series EE bond on January 10, 1990 for just $25. 
* If you try to cash the bond in 1993, you will pay a penalty.
* If you try to cash the bond on January 10, 1995, you will earn the $25. 
* If you try to cash the bond sometime after January 10, 1995 but before January 10, 2010, you will earn the $25 + interest accrued.
* If you try to cash the bond on January 10, 2010, you will earn the $50.
* If you try to cash the bond sometime after January 10, 2010 but before January 10, 2020, you will earn the $50 + interest accrued.
* If you try to cash the bond on January 10, 2020, you will earn the $50 and interest accrued since 2010. 
* If you try to cash the bond after January 10, 2020, you will earn the $50 and interest accrued from January 10, 2010 - January 10, 2020: not more.

Bonds typically earn very low interest, and so have gone relatively "out of vogue" in recent times. However, they are a common mechanism used to transition between major life stages. For instance, many family members will buy newborns government bonds, because the bonds will have matured by the time the child would like to cash them, and that money will have spent its time relatively safe. Bonds are also often used to transition people approaching retirement out of the market and into liquid cash again (these people gradually sell their index funds--collections of stock--and buy bonds instead as they approach retirement, as bonds tend to be substantially less risky than the stock market).

### Common investment products and vehicle types
This page will not cover intensely risky investment types and strategies like options/futures/etc, as many financial experts consider these types of investments to be unwise and unncessary for the vast majority of people (even very smart and well-educated people). 

**Investments**, meanwhile, are distinct from savings and checking accounts, etc, most critically by level of risk. Where most bank/credit union vehicles are considered relatively innoucous in comparison (due to the FDIC insurance), investment vehicles (**recall that some types of bonds are in fact investment products!**) are exposed to a high level of risk--the market can swing however it wants within complicated limits that this page won't get deep into because the finer points of U.S. financial legislation won't impact the average person's investment decisions. 

**The most important take-away of this entire page is that you are probably not suited to trade individual stocks -- and it's probably not wise, either. NOTE, CRITICALLY, THAT INVESTMENTS IN ANY CRYPROCURRENCIES CURRENTLY CARRY THE VERY SAME INTENSE AND VERY-PROBABLY-UNWISE RISK AS INDIVIDUAL STOCK TRADING.** When you say the word 'investing', you probably think of the rise and fall of Apple stock, or how you would've loved to own Google stock before it erupted. That kid in class, or your second-cousin-twice-removed, or your Uncle Steve, might go off on a rant about how they "lost all their money playing the stock market." Here's the truth, kids: the stock market is not a game. You don't "play" it. There are entire teams of very educated, very dedicated, very smart people on Wall Street et al that dedicate their entire lives to picking stocks, and they usually lose (often very badly) to these things called **index funds**/**mutual funds** (and in this way, picking individual stocks is very akin to gambling).

Index/mutual funds are collections of individual stocks. Investing in a mutual fund is considered less risky, and often more profit-generating, than investing in individual stocks. This is because your money is diversified across a much broader range of individual stocks. By investing in a mutual fund, your money gets distributed across entire slices of the market. If one stock falls, it can be balanced out by the rise in another. In this way, index funds more approximately follow the overall trend of the U.S. and/or global markets (depending on which mutual funds you choose). For this reason (and because the liklihood of bad stocks being balanced out and overcome by good ones rises as your exposure to the total market rises) many financial experts consider it wise to invest in mutual funds that focus not on specific industries, but on the total U.S. stock market, with some more minor exposure to total international markets as well. As a result, there are two main strategies that most people find suit their needs:

* The **"target retirement date" fund** strategy. If you're currently 18 as of 2017 and you plan to retire at 65 (and wanted to go with this strategy), you would pick the Target Retirement Date 2065 fund (offered by all three low-cost firms that are widely regarded as the best custodians to invest with -- Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab). These funds are offered in increments of 5 years (so 2055, 2060, 2065), so you pick the one closest to your intended retirement date, whenever that may be. These target retirement funds are made up of a mix of mutual funds and bonds that automatically start out with riskier investments when you're young and have many earning-years left, to less risky investments when you're old and can't expose yourself to the risk of losing everything if the market takes a downturn. As a result, you can "buy it and forget it" if you go with this strategy; just buy the fund and sell it off when you're ready to retire, no adjustments or monitoring needed from you (in fact, you probably **shouldn't monitor your portfolio often or ever if you scare easily: huge downturns in the market are common and tend to smooth themselves out--and continue to gain again--over long periods of time. The key to recovering from temporarily turn-downs in the market is leaving your money there untouched so it's there to capitalize on gains when the market turns upwards again. In short: losses are only realized when you sell (the same is true for gains).**) 
* The **"three-fund portfolio"** strategy. This is essentially the way target date retirement funds are composed behind the scenes, but instead of automatically being adjusted as time goes on, you have to adjust them yourself as you get older. This may be the appropriate choice for people who want to have a greater degree of control over their finances, but are not tempted to day-trade (i.e. make the very-likely-a-mistake choice of trading individual stocks). A three-fund portfolio is made up of some percentage of the U.S. Total Stock Market fund, the Total International Stock Market fund, and the Total Bond Fund, all three of which can be purchased through any major investment custodian like Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. The percentage of each is up to the investor; the total international mutual fund is considered the most risky, followed by the total U.S. market, followd by the total bond market--investors can adjust these holdings to their personal risk tolerance. Some common portfolio weights are listed on the Bogleheads Wiki (google "Bogleheads wiki and three fund portfolios").

Mutual funds come with fees, however, called the **"expense ratio"**. Because interest compounds overtime, the affect on an expense ratio of 1% may sound small, but it can actually be several hundreds of thousands of dollars over a long period of time. As a result, you want to find the lowest expense ratios possible for the mutual funds you want. Here are some approximate guidelines on good and bad expense ratios:
* over 1% = RUN 
* 0.75 - 1% = bad
* 0.50 - 0.75 = mediocre
* 0.25 - 0.50 = good
* 0.01 - 0.25 = excellent (this is typical of many mutual funds offered by Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab)

Sometimes bad expense ratios can sometimes be unavoidable through a company 401k plan; see the section below on 401k plans to help you decide when it may be worth investing in funds with bad expense ratios.
 
Now we've touched on the risk and strategy disadvantages of individual stocks and cryptocurrencies, on bonds and index/mutual funds and the two main strategies for building a portfolio with them. You may find yourself asking, but where do I put this portfolio? The answer is in a brokerage account, preferably wrapped by an investment vehicle.

There are two main types of vehicles, and they both require that you be employed: the 401k and the IRA. There are also standard brokerage accounts without the perks of the 401k and the IRA, and people who somehow manage to have disposable money without employment can buy securities to be held within those accounts instead. The 401k and the IRA can be thought of as "wrappers" that hold investments; you can usually hold the same securities in a regular brokerage account as you can a 401k or an IRA, the latter two just come with additional perks if you hold securities within them--but they also come with restrictions.

#### The 401k
The **401k** is a type of retirement investment vehicle that your employer must choose to offer. There are a couple key things to understand:
* In a traditional 401k, your contributions go in pre-tax (you avoid taxes putting the money in; when you withdraw from your 401k eventually, that's when you will incur the tax).
* In a Roth 401k (much less commonly offered than a traditional 401k), your contributions go in post-tax (you pay taxes as usual and then put the money in; when you withdraw from your 401k eventually, you do not have to pay taxes on that withdrawal). 
* Most employers choose to offer a "401k **match**", which is really what makes 401ks special and makes their impact go far on your retirement planning. A company may, for instance, choose to contribute 50% to the plan for every dollar you put in. So if you contribute $18,000 to the plan, your company will "match" $9000 of it, and contribute that $9000 to the plan: so you finish the year with $27,000 in the plan, 9k of which you didn't have to shell out. Without a company match, a 401k is not very special, but it does add another option for you to avoid taxes now and defer them to later, which makes sense for some people (especially, but not limited to, people who are in a higher tax bracket now than they will be in retirement).

If your employer does not choose to offer one (and you aren't self-employed, etc -- you can google all the special cases of 401ks), you simply don't have the option of investing in a 401k plan. Accordingly, most "white-collar" jobs will offer a 401k plan (so tech workers need not be very worried--your employer probably offers a plan), but many "blue-collar" jobs will not. This is because a 401k costs your company money to sponsor; the fees the company pays, and the fees you pay, will vary by the plan your company chooses. Let's define "plan": the 401k **plan** is the list of mutual funds and other securities being offered as choices by the brokerage company your company chooses as the 401k administrator. Your company pays this company some ampount of money to administer the plan; where *you* incur fees goes back to the topic of expense ratios. Top tech companies will usually choose a low-fee fund administrator and/or eat a lot of the fees themselves, to provide employees with low-cost options; less cash-heavy companies may choose less good plans with higher expense ratios. Whether or not you want to invest in high-expense-ratio choices is a decision that most people find comes down to the company match; for high expense ratios, it is sometimes worth investing as much as you need to to get the full company match, but usually not more (some companies will offer a match like "50% on the first 12k the employee invests", so in this case you'd invest 12k instead of the 2017 401k **total limit of $18,000/yr**, because the "free money" of the match is worth it, but investing past the match only incurs that huge expense ratio with nothing to offset that portion beyond that 12k). This is an analysis you will have to do for yourself, based on your companies' matching offer (if any), and the expense ratios of the securities you want to hold in your 401k. 

#### The IRA
Unlike the 401k, the IRA ("Individual Retirement Account" -- not the Irish militant group) not something offered by employers; you alone chose whether or not to invest in this retirement investment vehicle, and whether or not you can depends on if you have earned income (basically whether or not you make money from work: there are a few other minor categories of earned income, and you can google to find them). Like the 401k, there are two kinds of IRAs, but this time you get to choose which you invest in (you can also invest in both, but the **total overall limit of $5500/yr** for ages up to 50 stands -- the limit for ages 50 and above is $6500). These types are the same as in the 401k case:

* In a traditional IRA, your contributions go in pre-tax (you avoid taxes putting the money in; when you withdraw from your IRA eventually, that's when you will incur the tax). This is typically adviseable for people who are in higher tax brackets now than they will be in retirement.
* In a Roth IRA, your contributions go in post-tax (you pay taxes as usual and then put the money in; when you withdraw from your IRA eventually, you do not have to pay taxes on that withdrawal). This is typically adviseable for people who are in lower tax brackets now than they will be later, such as students.

However, there are additional **limits** on which kind of IRA you're allowed to directly invest in. People with high incomes, such as many tech workers, will find that they cannot deduct the amount contributed to a Traditional IRA from their taxes, as they make too much. Additionally, they will find they cannot contribute to a Roth IRA directly, as they make too much to be eligible. To get around these problems, they have to do a maneuver called a **backdoor Roth** to reap benefits from an IRA; you can google how to do a backdoor Roth and execute the steps with your chosen brokerage firm. It is important not to have previous contributions to a traditional IRA if you want to executive a backdoor Roth maneuver; so **please research the backdoor Roth maneuver and talk to a representative at your brokerage before taking steps to invest**.
